In this repository I'm implementing PyTorch based Deep Neural Networks from basic ANN to Advanced Graph Neural Networks. Please suggest if you have any ideas

### 1. Linear Regression [ANN] - Moore's Law
            - Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yvtsanlevy/moore-law
            - Type: Regression
            - Model: Artificial Neural Network

### 1. Linear Classification [ANN] - Breast Cancer
            - Dataset: scikit-learn in-built dataset
            - Type: Classification
            - Model: Artificial Neural Network
